# CHIP-8 Emulator

Written in Rustüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è!

This was my weekend project as a little reward to my self.
I like the thought of spending more time on this though, adding keyboard, schip/xo-chip support among other features.

My code is really nothing special, but if you're writing a CHIP-8 emulator and happen to get stuck. Feel free to email me [here](mailto:leahbowie@outlook.com) or message me on discord at ioniantropics.
